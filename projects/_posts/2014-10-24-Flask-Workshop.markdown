As part of ACM, we organized an internal University of Southern California hackathon aimed at students who have never been to a hackathon prior, or want to take part in a more relaxing and chill hackathon. Since we knew our target audience would like to pick up skills, we hosted a series of workshops throughout the hackathon to help them out. The workshop I held was the Flask workshop, where I introduced the Flask platform, and taught students to make a simple To Do web app. Through the workshop, we worked through routing, http methods, and even adding to a database.
