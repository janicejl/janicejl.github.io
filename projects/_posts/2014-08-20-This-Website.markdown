My old website served me well, it showed all the information that I wanted, and wasn't horrible looking. It allowed me to experiment with CSS, and getting responsiveness. However, updating and maintaining the website was a pain -- Everytime I wanted to update or add a project, I would have to open up the HTML file, add the right stuff, make sure not to mess up.. deploy it on to Google App Engine.. Find something broken and replay. I wanted something simplier and cleaner. 

Those were my aims in the redesign. In addition, I wanted a little more whitespace. I am now able to add projects by writing a new file in markdown, and using git. This is a work in progress. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments.
