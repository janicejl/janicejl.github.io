Senop description

During 7-9th February, I took part in the annual Brown University hackathon, Hack@Brown, with 3 other teammates (one also from USC, one from RPI and one from RISD). In the 28 hours, we were able to build a functional prototype of Senop to demonstrate to judges. We were given the opportunity to present Senop on stage as a finalist, and managed to win the 'Best Networking Porject' sponsored by Akamai. 

Since the hackathon, I wanted to improve the speed and user experience of Senop. Due to the 28-hour time constraint during the hackathon, each search request and dashboard refresh does a lot of processing and computation to provide the data needed on the dashboard. To do this, I moved the processing into a worker process with celery and rabbit-mq, and added an intermediate loading screen.
