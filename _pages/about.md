Hi -- Thanks for dropping by this website!

My name is Janice, and I'm a Software Engineer at X - The Moonshot Factory.

My goal is to contribute my skills to climate action. Working with and leading
teams to collectively 10x our impact on improving our planet.

When not working, I enjoy CrossFit, drums and cooperative board games.
